/**
 * Spatial audio for stereo tracks, in one of two [SpatialMode]s.
 *
 * [SpatialMode.SPATIALIZE] hands the float path to [StereoSpatializer]. [SpatialMode.WIDEN] is the
 * cheap stand-in this class started as: widens the mid/side image and mixes in
 * a short, low-passed cross-feed between channels — the same trick most
 * consumer virtual-surround plugins use. O(1) per sample, no FFT or
 * convolution, so it costs nothing worth measuring on a phone CPU.
 *
 * ## Latency and switching
 *
 * The spatializer delays the audio by [StereoSpatializer.latencyFrames] (~50 ms). While the effect is on, the
 * widener is delayed by the same amount, so switching between the two modes is a crossfade between time-aligned
 * signals: nothing skips, repeats or clicks. The incoming path is started ahead of the crossfade and fed until it
 * produces real output (the spatializer also until its steering has settled), so it never fades in from silence.
 *
 * Turning the effect on or off does change the latency, by those ~50 ms. That switch is a short crossfade as well,
 * so it cannot click, though under it ~50 ms of audio is skipped (off) or heard twice (on). [latencyFrames]
 * reports the current delay so the player's position follows what is actually heard.
 *
 * A new stream (after a seek, flush or format change) starts directly on the right path without a crossfade.
 * The next track of a gapless run in the same format continues on the running path, tail and all.
 *
 * Exists because the platform [android.media.audiofx.Virtualizer] produced no
 * audible difference on the reference device — likely swallowed by the OEM's
 * own audio effect chain — so this runs inside ExoPlayer's own audio
 * processor pipeline instead, where nothing else can intercept it.
